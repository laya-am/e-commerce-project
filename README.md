# e-commerce-project

This is a front page website design for a garden design business called Lucky Shrub. The website is designed fully responsive in all sizes with the help of plain CSS. Some interactivity is added to the design for the sake of a better User Experience. To improve the User Interface color theory and appealing proportions were considered in the design.
There's no Bootstrap or javascript used in this project. The purpose of this project was to practice CSS grid display and responsiveness.
